Arrays
Arrays are one of the most fundamental and versatile data structures in computer science and programming. An array is a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. These elements can be of the same type, and they are stored in contiguous memory locations, making it efficient to access elements by their index.

Arrays provide a simple and efficient way to store and manage a group of values of the same data type. They are commonly used for a wide range of applications, from simple data storage to complex algorithms and data manipulation.

Key Characteristics of Arrays:
Homogeneous: In an array, all elements are of the same data type, which allows for efficient memory allocation and manipulation.

Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size defined at the time of creation. This size does not change during the array's lifetime.

Random Access: Elements in an array can be accessed directly using their index, which allows for fast and constant-time access.

Contiguous Memory Allocation: Elements are stored in adjacent memory locations, making access efficient but limiting the flexibility to change the size dynamically.

Common Array Operations:
Access: Retrieve elements from the array by specifying their index.

Insertion: Add new elements at a specific position within the array.

Deletion: Remove elements from the array, shifting the remaining elements to close the gap.

Search: Find the index or presence of a specific element within the array.

Update: Modify the value of an element at a specific index.

Arrays are the building blocks of many other data structures, like lists, stacks, and queues. They are a crucial concept in computer science and a foundation for solving various programming problems efficiently.
