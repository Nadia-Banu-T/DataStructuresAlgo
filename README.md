# DataStructuresAlgo

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository contains a collection of code and explanations for various data structures and algorithms. 

## Introduction

This repository is a resource for learning and practicing data structures and algorithms. You'll find code examples, explanations, and solutions to common problems related to these topics. 

## Topics

Here are some of the data structures and algorithms covered in this repository:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, etc.)
- Graphs
- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- and more!

The repository is organized into folders corresponding to each topic, and you'll find problem-specific code files and explanations inside those folders.

Thank You.
